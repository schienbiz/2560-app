# Changelog

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Proximity alert**: daily scan now fires when price is within 1.5% of MA25 in a golden cross
  environment (`proximity_golden` signal type)
- **Zone exit alert**: fires when price exits the entry zone (>3% from MA25) after a proximity
  alert in the preceding 3 days (`proximity_exit` signal type)
- **AI-generated cross messages**: golden cross and death cross notifications now include a
  Groq-powered analysis; falls back to raw template on API failure
- **Deep-link in alerts**: all push notifications append a `?symbol=` URL that opens the Chart
  tab directly in the app
- **Morning summary** (`cron/morning-summary.ts`): 8am Taipei time GitHub Actions cron sends a
  filtered AI digest — only symbols with an active cross signal; "all quiet" message when none
- **Alert history UI**: new section in Reminders tab shows last 30 signal events from
  `GET /api/signals`
- **Deep-link routing in app.js**: `?symbol=` query param on page load auto-navigates to Chart
  tab; `history.replaceState` strips the param after processing
- **`GET /api/signals` endpoint**: returns last N signal history entries scoped to the
  authenticated user's watchlist symbols (no user_id on SignalHistory — queries via watchlist)
- **`tests/signals-route.test.ts`**: 7 unit tests for limit-parsing logic (default, clamp, NaN,
  empty, boundary, minimum)

### Migration
- Added `proximity_golden` and `proximity_exit` to `SignalType` enum
- Run: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Infrastructure
- `.github/workflows/morning-summary.yml`: new cron workflow (00:00 UTC = 08:00 Taipei)
- `INTERNAL_SECRET` and `APP_URL` GitHub secrets required for morning summary workflow
